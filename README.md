## LDTS_T10G1004 - Get out!

------

Nick Heya is the new superhero that arrived to Earth, just in time to stop the purest of the evils, Black Holer, from making our planet to be swallowed! But during their fight, they were trapped in another dimension full of monsters, and Nick has no guns!

In this challenging platform game, help Nick escape alive and collect as many coins as you can so Nick can buy the fastest trip back to Earth! Throughout ten different levels, survive the horrifying monsters and find the keys to 'Get out!'
